				</div>
				<p>This website was the product of hard work and a passion for design.</p>
				<p>Well, while this is true, it was mostly just fun.</p>
				<p>I love making things, and making them right. I enjoy designing sleek content, just like this site, but I also have fun getting down and dirty with C. I used to use Python for everything but have since discovered the power of Bash.</p>
