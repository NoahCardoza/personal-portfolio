          <p>To sum it up in just a few words, I'm a 17 year-old computer enthusiast. I'm just finishing up my first quarter at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.deanza.edu/">De Anza</a> community college. A pretty great quarter over all. I am also enrolled at <a target="_blank" href="http://42.us.org">42</a>, which is a tuition free programming university funded by French billionaire <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/Muk2Rd">Xavier Niel</a>. How cool is that?</p>
          <p>I spend my free time messing around with my Mac Book Pro and starting all kinds of wacky projects.</p>
          <p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

          <p>This is where I host a few of my smaller projects (including this site!). Feel free to check out the source code! Although there isn't much of a backend.</p>
          <h3><a target="_blank" href="http://battleofthe.net/">BOT.net</a></h3>
          <p>This is a little side project I and a friend have been working on for the past few months. Progress has been slow since we both have school but with winter break coming up, we hope to get back to work!</p>
